A large international recruitment agency is thinking of expanding into the German market and wants to find out about potential market areas.
We, as data analysts, looked into the labour market in Germany in different fields using datsets from Agentur f√ºr Arbeit from 2019 to 2023 and analysed the number of open positions and number of unemployed in Civil Engineering, Electrotechnics and Informatics. In parallel, we checked the number of students that would qualify for the 3 previously mentioned fields to see if they would be able to fill the open positions. For the students information we used datasets provided by DeStatis- Statistische Bundesamt.
